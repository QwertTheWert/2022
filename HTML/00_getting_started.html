		Some text written by Cicero that's used to fill spaces on graphical design and publishing before the actual words have been written. The reason why it is difficult to understand is to draw attention away from the words on a page and to focus it on the design instead. It's also useful for filling spaces where text should be because its words are about the same length as normal English writing.

		It roughly means: Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
